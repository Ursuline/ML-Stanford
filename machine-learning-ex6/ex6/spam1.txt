What was not plundered by government, was taken bygangsters.My brother urged me to come to America as all hope for a decent and safe future in South Africa faded over the horizon. It was easier said than done because the local currency lost value against the dollar at the speed of sound and the price of going to the States became astronomical.In February 1998 my brother phoned me to tell me that he has secured a job for meand a work permit. (Green card) I sold my little business and all our furnitureto purchase a plane ticket to the U.S.A.When I got there, I found out that he has lied to me in order to get me to the Statesso that he could show off his new car and house and other "toys."I could not secure a job because I did not have the necessary work permit.Sadly I had to return to South Africa with no more money left. A friend lent us his oldtrailer to live in and we are battling to make a living.We have two teenage children and our wish is for them to be able to go to America and get a decent upbringing. As things stand now, there is no hope that we canget our kids out of this hell-hole that they call South Africa without outside help.We would like to appeal for any help you are able to give or any small donation (even if it is only $5) so that we can secure the future of our precious children.Please deposit your donation in MASTER CARD account number 541193163339015in the name of:Mrs. L. E. du Toit, P. O. Box 4494, POTGIETERSRUS,  0600Northern ProvinceRepublic of South AfricaYour help is greatly appreciated.God Bless!!Pieter and family.pdt@potties.lia.net
